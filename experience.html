        <p>I became a big lover of hiking and climbing after I graduated from high school. There are many mountains in my hometown. During that summer, I started enjoying climbing mountains alone or with my friends and family. I met and walked along with different people on my way. I enjoyed views along the way and the sense of achievement on the top of the mountain. There were lots of fun stories and risks happened along the way. During the year when I was in Seattle, I also visited many mountains with my friends, with totally different experiences and beautiful sceneries that I saw in my homwtown.</p>
